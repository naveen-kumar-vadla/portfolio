                    I’m a backend-focused software engineer with experience designing and building scalable,

                    At ThoughtWorks, I've delivered critical components for European e-commerce platforms, built
                    microservices for customer accounting,
                    and automated cloud infrastructure using <strong>Terraform</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>.

                    I’ve played a key role in mentoring new developers and managing an internal apprenticeship
                    program—
                    conducting training sessions, reviewing assignments, and providing ongoing support.

                    I care deeply about clean code, knowledge sharing, and building backend systems that are robust,
